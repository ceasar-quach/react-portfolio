A full-stack web application combines frontend, backend, and database components into a single cohesive system.
- The frontend handles user interaction and presentation, while the backend manages data processing and server-side logic. 
- The database stores and manages application data. Full-stack developers are proficient in both frontend and backend development, allowing them to build and maintain all aspects of a web application.

This integrated approach offers flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in development and deployment.
