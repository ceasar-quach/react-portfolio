As technology specialist at DataPi, I appreciate a chance of being the Business Manager assistance to gain an insight of how a business operate, where the time and the quality of every decision for each design and development project will affect the direction of the business and vice versa.

Working at Fortinet is like a journey through the IT and computer networking world. That said, I'm grateful for such great opportunity to become a UX designers who can effectively communicate and present my delivers to PMs, stake holders, and users while understand and comply with many technical-heavy requirements.

With these several years of experience working in the IT industry - fearlessly taking on high working volume while wearing both a designer and a developer hat, assuring the cost and benefit between the quality and time of all designs and development projects has always been my top priority.
Outside of work, I always enjoy hiking, swimming, badminton-ing, and photo shooting.
