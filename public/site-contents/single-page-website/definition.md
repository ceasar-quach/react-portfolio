A single-page website is a type of website that contains all of its content on a single, scrollable page, rather than spreading it across multiple pages. This type of website design is often used for simplicity and ease of navigation, particularly for smaller websites or those that don't require a lot of content.


Single-page websites typically feature sections or segments that users can navigate to by scrolling or clicking on navigation links, rather than loading separate pages. They can be quite effective for presenting concise information or showcasing a specific product or service.
